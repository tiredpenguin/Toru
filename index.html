Our 2D point-and-click game represents Haruki Murakami's answer to existentialism from his book, Norwegian Wood. The main character in the game is Toru Watanabe whose movements are limited to a linear pathing. As the player navigates Toru forward, the scenery shifts to different memories he recalls throughout a specific period of his life. The scenes are significant events beginning with Toru's dorm to the restaurant he meets Midori, and Naoko's meadow. The entire gameplay is Toru's recollection of Naoko and how he preserves her memories.
The style of the game is expressed through quotes from the book and the main scenes that Toru remembers much of the important encounters with the few people he interacts with. The game puts together his memories with transitions that are dream-like, all leading to the questionable ending. The final stage is our impression of what happens. Though we follow the book with Midori’s quote asking, “Where are you now?” We decided to add more quotes throughout the book that spirals off Midori’s question. The idea we want to express is that Toru is left alone with his memories and thoughts, ideas and words from the Midori, Naoko, and Reiko who have all left an impact on him. Their presence will always live in his mind no matter how long time has passed.
